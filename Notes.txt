2. should we use one file for one character or something?

3. we need get custom action is best way to use for heroes and unit

death attack1 attack2 move idle

managed game on object which is a tile (have unit on it get status?)

when unit attact(example) -> get tile status, weather status, -> match object
player have list unit
